## ----------- General Info ---------

**Objective**: Log in to Windows-based devices (computers, tablets, smart boards, etc.) by scanning a QR code with your phone.

### How It Works:

1. **Setup on PC**:
   - Run the PC application as an administrator.
   - Enter the server address and password in the settings, and create a general backup password (this allows login without a QR code in case of verification issues).
   - All entered information is saved, and a QR code is generated.

2. **Setup on Phone**:
   - Open the app and enter the server address, server password, and security code generated by the PC app.
   - Scan the QR code to verify.

3. **Verification Process**:
   - Phone app verifies the QR code first. If verified, it displays "verified" in the app.
   - Click the "QR Code Verification" button on both the phone and PC.
   - Once verified, login is granted.

4. **System Notifications**:
   - The PC displays a message on successful or failed QR code verification.
   - If verification is not completed within **150 seconds**, the PC shuts down automatically for security.
   - If an attempt is made to force quit the application from the Task Manager without verification, the system will shut down for security reasons.

### Working Logic:
- The PC application combines the server address, server password, and security code, encrypts this data, and creates a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) server over Port 80.
- The phone decodes the encrypted QR code, parses the information, and compares it with the data on the mobile app.
- Upon successful verification from both devices, login is completed.

**Languages Used**:
- **PC Application**: C#, Visual Basic, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
- **Phone Application**: Java

### Outcome:
With a single QR code, you can log in to Windows devices (computers, tablets, smart boards) and perform additional functions like file transfer, PC snapshot, and cross-platform control.
